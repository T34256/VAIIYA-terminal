# Welcome to the VAIIYA terminal project page!

Welcome VAIIYA trustees and fellow THE FINALS contestants!
welcome to my VAIIYA terminal project page! 

VAIIYA terminal is a for-fun project made by me and serves mostly the purpose of being entertainment and a story module! 
I hope you can join me on my long journey of making this dream come true with me!
