# Welcome to the VAIIYA terminal project page!

Welcome to the VAIIYA Terminal project page!! 
I am very happy to show you all my VAIIYA TERMINAL passion project! 
the real purpose for this "game" was just an idea and a very far fetched idea that Embark Rob may collab with it ( I still think its far fetched but it is a good learning course! )

and that i saw how much retro stuff (eg, the commandprompt credits screen for S2 and S3.) was used and i saw how VAIIYA would use somthing like that. 

also as a side note: this will be a very good experemantation for password protected encryption as the sourcecode is here on github. so dont be alarmed if there is some gobbleygook in the code :3 


( ps; rob if you read this, can i have the offical VAIIYA ASCII art for my code plz üôèü•π ) 

# The game
 for "virus" suspisions;
 
**BEFORE YOU ASK IF IT IS VIRUS PLEASE LOOK IN SOURCE CODE!**

*this entire game is made in python v3.11 so thats why the files say .py if you ask if virus*

*and the EXE files are made with the py2exe-gui tool (look it up)*
