# Contributing 

Hello fello VAIIYA Trustees! if you want to help with the progress of VAIIYA Terminal, here are some basic rules and things to know!  

### Setup

1. get Github desktop if you dont have it already :3  

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> *make sure you are using a **global** installation of python 3 for it to recognise the installed modules! if you use the "recommended" one with VS code, you will get errors of `reportMissingImports`!*  
> get the latest release here: [python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone the repository and get dependencies 
     - clone the repository with the HTTPS method through Github desktop 
     - open the filestructure in VS code or your perferred IDE 
     - install dependencies inside the filestructure with `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
     - run `VAIIYA terminal.py` with the run button in VScode or your own IDE to see if everything is working! 
  
> [!TIP]
> it is recommended that you install the pylance extension for VScode, as it has really nice fetures for debugging and other! 


and thats all for setup! 

### Contributing rules 

1. any new changes when being merged get sent to the experimental branch. 
2. large changes **can** have their own branch, then will be merged to the experimental branch later on. 

> [!NOTE]
> these contributing rules are still very scratched together for now, so a lot of self judgement will be applied for new rules to form.
