# Welcome to the VAIIYA terminal project page!

Welcome to the VAIIYA Terminal project page!! 

I am very happy to show you all my VAIIYA TERMINAL passion project!

The real purpose for this "game" was just an idea and a very far fetched idea that Embark Rob may collab with ( I still think it's far fetched but it is a good learning course! ).

I saw how retro stuff (eg, the commandprompt credits screen for S2 and S3.) was used and I thought VAIIYA could use something like that. 

A side note: this program will be a very good experimentation for password protected encryption as the source code is here on Github. Don't be alarmed if you see "gobbleygook" in the code :3 

(PS. Rob if you read this, may I please use the *offical VAIIYA ASCII art* for my code plz! üôè )
